## Abstract:


We are interested in investigating the hierarchical structure of processing object categorization in the human brain. Cichy and colleagues (2014) have demonstrated how the brain processes objects over time: whereas all individual images are discriminated by earlier visual areas, superordinate, ordinate and subordinate category images emerged later. 
However, the prior study trained the dataset with a supervised machine learning classifier using a predefined category for a given image as the outcome variable, it remains elusive to what extent humans really use this structure of ordinates and subordinate categories to classify images. Therefore, first, we hope to deploy some unsupervised methods to find new ways of clustering images based on neuronal responses (in the format of RMD from MEG) and to understand the structure of these high-dimensional categories. Second, we hope to understand how human brain processes different information to categorize a given image more parsimoniously by looking at the relationships between objective attribute similarity (lines, edges, colors of the images), representational dissimilarity/perceptual similarity in the infero temporal and early visual region, and conceptual similarities of image labels (computed through word embedding model).
